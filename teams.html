      <h2>Teams</h2>
      <p>Though the drivers are often granted the lion’s share of the glory, Formula One is at its heart a team sport. Teams operate differently in motorsport than they do in other popular sports. Formula One teams are composed of designers, engineers, mechanics, pit crews, radio operators, strategists, and businessmen. Each team member is responsible for the efficient operation of a multi-million-dollar organization that operates at the bleeding edge of automotive design and technology. Additionally, teams are not tied to specific places like a school, city, or region.</p>
      <p>Teams can operate as part of major automotive manufacturers like Ferrari and Renault, may have been founded by former drivers Williams and McLaren, or may even be owned by Austrian energy drink companies like Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso. It may also be confusing to keep some teams straight. Formula One is an expensive sport, and teams may come in and out of competition frequently. Sometimes a team may be bought and the name changed. But through all the tumultuous politics, a handful of teams stand out as exemplary organizations with histories of innovation, shrewd strategy, and sometimes just a lot of money.</p>

McLaren has won at least one Championship in every decade since the 1970s, save the current decade. Partnerships with engine manufacturers Porsche, Honda and Mercedes along with the leadership of team principal Ron Dennis granted great success in the 1980s and 1990s.

          <li>Nationality: Austria</li>

They remain a top contender in the current Formula One season with the prodigiously talented driver Max Verstappen.</li>

        <h3>Mercedes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Years Active: 1954-1955, 2010-Present</li>
          <li>Nationality: Germany</li>

          <li>The "Silver Arrows" were founded in 1954 and shepherded some of the success of Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Mercedes withdrew from grand prix racing after the tragic disaster at Le Mans in 1955. Although they were a successful engine supplier for McLaren in the 1990s and 2000s, the team did not return in true form until 2010. Mercedes has held total control over both Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships since the advent of the hybrid racing era beginning in 2014. They most recently locked up the 2019 World Constructors' Championship and show no signs of stopping.</li>
