     <h1>Formula One Legends</h1>
     <div class="flex-container">
       <div class="intro>"><p><br/>Grand prix racing has existed, in one form or another, since the invention and proliferation of automobiles. In 1950, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (or International Automobile Federation) inaugurated the Formula One World Championship. Since then, Formula One has been the premier international single-seater racing league in the world. Drivers and teams have come from countries like England, Brazil, France, Japan, Germany, Italy, the United States, Mexico, Russia, and Australia among other many other. Races have been held from deep the Ardennes Forest in Belgium, to the streets of Singapore. Millions attend these races or tune in through television, radio, and the internet.</p>

      <p><br/>Formula 1 has had deep cultural impact. Names like Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Mercedes, Ferrari, Nürburgring, and Monaco may be familiar to those who have never heard of tire compounds, rear downforce, DRS, or pole positions. Films like <i>Senna</i>, <i>Rush</i>, and <i>Grand Prix</i> have documented the drama of Formula One racing.</p>

     <p><br/>Unfortunately, Formula One is not as popular in the United States as it is in Europe, Asia, or South America. The U.S. currently hosts grand prix every year in Austin, Texas and has hosted races for decades in Detroit, Long Beach, Las Vegas, Dallas, Indianapolis, Phoenix, and Watkins Glen. However, the popularity of F1 has never quite reached the popularity of homegrown motorsports like IndyCar and NASCAR. I personally had to seek out exposure to the sport when my interest was piqued by chance when I was a young adult.</p>

     <p><br/>I have not been much of a sports fan. As an Ann Arbor native as well as an undergraduate and graduate student at the University Michigan, I have gone to and watched Michigan football, basketball, and hockey games. One of my earliest memories is attending a Baltimore Orioles game. I played baseball when I was young and ran track in middle school. However, no sport truly held my attention for very long until I discovered Formula One racing. Between my freshman sophomore years of college, I was working at a video library, where I caught sight of the box for the documentary <i>Senna</i>. I thought it looked interesting enough to take home. The compelling story of the life of Ayrton Senna awoke in me a desire to explore more about this sport. I played video games, read up online, and watched races. I was hooked on the spectacle, the drama, the athleticism, and the technology on display. Formula One helped get me through a tough time and has been an enduring source of joy in my life.</p>

     <p><br/>I would like to take this opportunity to spread this joy to others. I have collected here some of the drivers, teams, and cars that I have found so inspiring. I hope there is a chance that perusing this selection may spark some of the same interest in Formula One and motorsport that has compelled me. Plus, fan or no fan, everyone loves lists.</p></div>

     <h3>For the uninitiated, I will include a glossary of terms that may be unfamiliar to those without knowledge of F1:</h3>
   </br>
      <ul>
       <li>Formula: The set of rules and regulations that regulate the construction and racing of open-wheeled single-seater automobiles. The FIA sets down the formula to which each team and driver must adhere.</li>
       <li>Podium: A top three finish at the end of a race.</li>
        <li>Pole Position: The first spot in the starting order for a race. In Formula 1, qualifying sessions are held before a race to determine the starting order. During qualifying, drivers are given limited amounts of time to record a fast lap time. The way that qualifying is conducted has changed over the years, but it is enough to say that the driver with the fastest time at the end of qualifying receives the pole position.</li>
       <li>World Drivers’ Championship: The honor awarded to the most successful driver of a Formula One Season. During each Grand Prix, drivers are awarded points based on where they finish the race. The driver with the most cumulative points at the end of the season is awarded the World Championship.</li>
        <li>World Constructors’ Championship: The honor awarded to the most successful team of a Formula One Season. During each Grand Prix, teams are awarded points based on their drivers did during a race. The team with the most cumulative points at the end of the season is awarded the World Championship.</li>
     </ul>
